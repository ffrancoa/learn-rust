# ðŸ¦€ 100 Exercises to Learn Rust â€” Exercises Only

This is a personal fork of [mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust](https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust), with the `book/` folder removed. The idea is to keep things simple and focus just on practicing the exercises.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why this fork?

The original project includes a companion book, but for my purposes, I only need the code-based exercises. This fork is:

- A personal workspace to learn and practice Rust.
- A lighter version of the original repo â€” no book, just code.
- A backup for my progress, where I may add comments, notes, or alternative solutions over time.
